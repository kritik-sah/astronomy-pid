Note:

1. initialy i tried to use next 13 server side data fetching, but it was not not working properly so i used client side data fetching
2. I was using custom infinite scroll but then i found this package "react-infinite-scroll-component" which is better then mine. so i used it.
3. I built custom masonry before using css flex but i have to put that in column and have to make height fixed. but now with "react-masonry-css" it made it way simpler.

now: its working fine even in production.
